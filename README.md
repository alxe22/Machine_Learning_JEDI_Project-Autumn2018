## General description of the project
During our winter break we took an extracurricular course about Machine Learning and Python. Here we learned how to use Python and it's libraries for Machine Learning, in order to finish up the course programming a small Collaboratory document where we applied everything we have learned. This project uses the [Seattle Terry Stops](https://www.kaggle.com/city-of-seattle/seattle-terry-stops/version/8) dataset in order to extract the data needed to train our models.
Using all the data available we decided to predict whether a subject would be arrested by the police.
